# PhaseFold Web

A WIP port of web port of https://github.com/loopwrk/PhaseFold

## Overview

AccessLab provides hands-on learning for web accessibility by allowing developers to:

- Interact with common UI components (buttons, carousels, modals, etc.)
- Adjust component properties in real-time (dimensions, colors, text size)
- See automated accessibility violations detected by axe-core
- Understand the difference between automated testing and manual review
- Learn WCAG compliance through practical examples

Built with Nuxt 4, Vue 3, TypeScript, and Nuxt UI.

## Disclaimer

**This is a work-in-progress prototype.** The project is in early development with the Button component being the most complete demo. Other component pages are placeholders awaiting implementation.
